**Validation Date:** 2026-02-06

## Input Documents

- PRD: prd.md
- Product Brief: product-brief-WardenWeb-2026-02-05.md
- Brainstorming: brainstorming-session-2026-02-05.md

## Validation Findings

## Format Detection

**PRD Structure (Level 2 Headers):**
1. Executive Summary
2. Success Criteria
3. Product Scope
4. User Journeys
5. Domain-Specific Requirements
6. Web App Specific Requirements
7. Project Scoping & Phased Development
8. Functional Requirements
9. Non-Functional Requirements

**BMAD Core Sections Present:**
- Executive Summary: Present
- Success Criteria: Present
- Product Scope: Present
- User Journeys: Present
- Functional Requirements: Present
- Non-Functional Requirements: Present

**Format Classification:** BMAD Standard
**Core Sections Present:** 6/6

## Information Density Validation

**Anti-Pattern Violations:**

**Conversational Filler:** 0 occurrences

**Wordy Phrases:** 0 occurrences

**Redundant Phrases:** 0 occurrences

**Total Violations:** 0

**Severity Assessment:** Pass

**Recommendation:** PRD demonstrates good information density with minimal violations. FRs use direct language ("User can...", "System processes..."). Tables provide structured data without filler.

## Product Brief Coverage

**Product Brief:** product-brief-WardenWeb-2026-02-05.md

### Coverage Map

| Brief Content | PRD Location | Coverage |
|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Vision Statement | Executive Summary → Vision | Fully Covered |
| Target Users | Executive Summary + User Journeys | Fully Covered |
| Problem Statement | Executive Summary | Fully Covered |
| Key Features | Product Scope + FRs | Fully Covered |
| Goals/Objectives | Success Criteria | Fully Covered |
| Differentiators | Executive Summary → Differentiator | Fully Covered |

### Coverage Summary

**Overall Coverage:** 100%
**Critical Gaps:** 0
**Moderate Gaps:** 0
**Informational Gaps:** 0

**Recommendation:** PRD provides excellent coverage of Product Brief content.

## Measurability Validation

### Functional Requirements

**Total FRs Analyzed:** 34

**Format Violations:** 0 - All follow "[Actor] can [capability]" pattern

**Subjective Adjectives Found:** 0

**Vague Quantifiers Found:** 0

**Implementation Leakage:** 0 (Stripe/Firebase references acceptable as architectural decisions)

**FR Violations Total:** 0

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Total NFRs Analyzed:** 16

**Missing Metrics:** 0

**Incomplete Template:** 2 (minor - some items lack explicit measurement method)

**Missing Context:** 1 (minor - some items lack "why")

**NFR Violations Total:** 3 (minor)

### Overall Assessment

**Total Requirements:** 50
**Total Violations:** 3 (minor)

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** Requirements demonstrate good measurability. Minor improvements possible for NFR context but not blocking.

## Traceability Validation

### Chain Validation

**Executive Summary → Success Criteria:** Intact

**Success Criteria → User Journeys:** Intact

**User Journeys → Functional Requirements:** Intact (PRD includes explicit Journey Requirements Summary)

**Scope → FR Alignment:** Intact

### Orphan Elements

**Orphan Functional Requirements:** 0

**Unsupported Success Criteria:** 0

**User Journeys Without FRs:** 0

### Traceability Summary

| Chain | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Vision → Success | Intact |
| Success → Journeys | Intact |
| Journeys → FRs | Intact |
| Scope → FRs | Intact |

**Total Traceability Issues:** 0

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** Traceability chain is intact - all requirements trace to user needs or business objectives.

## Implementation Leakage Validation

### Leakage by Category

**Frontend Frameworks:** 0 violations (Next.js in Web App Reqs section, not in FRs)

**Backend Frameworks:** 0 violations

**Databases:** 0 violations (Firestore references are capability-relevant)

**Cloud Platforms:** 0 violations (Firebase references are capability-relevant)

**Infrastructure:** 0 violations

**Libraries:** 0 violations

**Payment Provider:** 0 violations (Stripe references are capability-relevant)

### Summary

**Total Implementation Leakage Violations:** 0

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** No implementation leakage found. Technology references (Stripe, Firebase, Firestore) are capability-relevant as they describe WHAT integration capabilities the system needs, aligned with architectural decisions in Web App Requirements section.

**Note:** PRD correctly separates architecture (Web App Reqs) from capability requirements (FRs/NFRs).

## Domain Compliance Validation

**Domain:** general
**Complexity:** Low (standard subscription portal)
**Assessment:** N/A - No special domain compliance requirements

**Note:** PRD exceeds baseline by including Domain-Specific Requirements section with GDPR compliance, account deletion flow, and cookie consent despite "general" domain classification. PCI-DSS handled via Stripe delegation.

**Severity:** Pass (exceeds requirements)

## Project-Type Compliance Validation

**Project Type:** web_app

### Required Sections

| Section | Status |
|---------|--------|
| browser_matrix | Present |
| responsive_design | Present |
| performance_targets | Present |
| seo_strategy | Present |
| accessibility_level | Present |

### Excluded Sections (Should Not Be Present)

| Section | Status |
|---------|--------|
| native_features | Absent ✓ |
| cli_commands | Absent ✓ |

### Compliance Summary

**Required Sections:** 5/5 present
**Excluded Sections Violations:** 0
**Compliance Score:** 100%

**Severity:** Pass

## SMART Requirements Validation

**Total Functional Requirements:** 34

### Scoring Summary

**All scores ≥ 3:** 100% (34/34)
**All scores ≥ 4:** 100% (34/34)
**Overall Average Score:** 5.0/5.0

### Assessment

All FRs meet SMART quality criteria:
- **Specific:** All follow "[Actor] can [capability]" pattern
- **Measurable:** All are testable with clear acceptance conditions
- **Attainable:** All are realistic for subscription portal MVP
- **Relevant:** All trace to user journeys or domain requirements
- **Traceable:** All map back to business objectives

**Low-Scoring FRs:** 0

**Severity:** Pass

**Recommendation:** Functional Requirements demonstrate excellent SMART quality.

## Holistic Quality Assessment

### Document Flow & Coherence

**Strengths:**
- Clear narrative arc from vision to requirements
- Sections flow logically without repetition
- Tables used effectively for structured data

### Dual Audience Effectiveness

**For Humans:** Excellent - Executive summary, developer FRs, designer journeys all clear

**For LLMs:** Excellent - Machine-readable structure, ready for UX/Architecture/Epic generation

**Dual Audience Score:** 5/5

### BMAD PRD Principles Compliance

| Principle | Status |
